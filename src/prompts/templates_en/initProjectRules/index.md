# Project Rules Initialization Guide

## Purpose

**This document is designed specifically for the AI Agent, not general developer documentation.**
**A project specification file (rules.md) specifically for AI Agent operations MUST be generated.**

**Must focus on the following key objectives:**

- Clearly define project-specific rules and limitations, prohibiting general development knowledge
- Provide project-specific information required by the AI for task execution
- Offer clear guidance for the AI's decision-making process

**Mandatory Requirements:**

- The completed specification must enable the AI Agent to immediately understand which files must be referenced or modified
- Clearly indicate multi-file 联动 modification requirements (e.g., modifying README.md requires simultaneous modification of /docs/zh/README.md)
- Use imperative language to define rules, avoiding explanatory content
- Do not explain project functionality, but rather how to modify or add features
- Provide examples of what can and cannot be done

**Strictly Prohibited:**

- Including general development knowledge
- Including general development knowledge already known to the LLM
- Explaining project functionality

## Suggested Structure

Please use the following structure to create the specification file:

```markdown
# Development Guidelines

## Heading

### Subheading

- Rule one
- Rule two
```

## Content Guide

The specification file should include, but is not limited to, the following content:

1. **Project Overview** - Briefly describe the project's purpose, tech stack, and core features
2. **Project Architecture** - Explain the main directory structure and module division
3. **Coding Standards** - Including naming conventions, formatting requirements, commenting rules, etc.
4. **Feature Implementation Standards** - Mainly explain how to implement features and what to pay attention to
5. **Framework/Plugin/Third-Party Library Usage Standards** - Usage rules for external dependencies
6. **Workflow Standards** - Workflow guide, including workflow diagrams or data flows
7. **Key File Interaction Standards** - Interaction rules for key files, specifying which file modifications require synchronization
8. **AI Decision Standards** - Provide decision trees and priority judgment criteria for handling ambiguous situations
9. **Prohibitions** - Clearly list practices that are forbidden

## Important Notes

1. **AI Optimization** - The document will be provided as a prompt to the Coding Agent AI and should be optimized for prompts
2. **Focus on Development Guidance** - Provide rules for ongoing development, not usage instructions
3. **Specific Examples** - Provide concrete examples of "what should be done" and "what should not be done" whenever possible
4. **Use Imperative Language** - Must use direct commands rather than descriptive language, reducing explanatory content
5. **Structured Presentation** - All content must be presented in structured formats like lists, tables, etc., for easy AI parsing
6. **Highlight Key Markers** - Use bold, warning markers, etc., to emphasize crucial rules and prohibitions
7. **Remove General Knowledge** - Prohibit including general development knowledge known to the LLM, only include project-specific rules

Please create a file named rules.md based on the guidelines above and store it at: {rulesPath}

**Now start calling the "process_thought" tool to think about how to write the specification file to guide the Coding Agent**
**After thinking, immediately edit the rules.md file. Calling the "analyze_task" tool is prohibited**
**If the file already exists or the user requests an update, consider if the rules are outdated and need supplementation or updates**
**In update mode, you should maintain existing rules unless necessary, modifying with the principle of minimal change**
