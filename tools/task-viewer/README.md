# ü¶ê Shrimp Task Manager Viewer

A modern, React-based web interface for viewing and managing [Shrimp Task Manager](https://github.com/cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager) tasks created through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool. This visual interface allows you to see detailed task information, track progress across multiple projects, and easily copy task UUIDs for AI agent interactions.

## Why Use Shrimp Task Viewer?

When using Shrimp Task Manager as an MCP server with AI agents like Claude, this viewer provides essential visibility into your task ecosystem:

- **Visual Task Overview**: See all tasks, their status, dependencies, and progress in a clean tabbed interface
- **UUID Management**: Click any task badge to instantly copy its UUID for commands like `"Use task manager to complete this shrimp task: [UUID]"`
- **Parallel Execution**: Open multiple terminals and use the AI Actions column (ü§ñ) to copy task instructions for parallel AI agent execution
- **Live Updates**: Direct file path reading ensures you always see the current task state
- **Multi-Project Support**: Manage tasks across different projects with draggable profile tabs

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

To make environment variables persistent across terminal sessions, add them to your shell configuration file:

**For macOS/Linux with Zsh** (default on modern macOS):
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SHRIMP_VIEWER_PORT=9998' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SHRIMP_VIEWER_HOST=127.0.0.1' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

**For Linux/Unix with Bash**:
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export SHRIMP_VIEWER_PORT=9998' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export SHRIMP_VIEWER_HOST=127.0.0.1' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Why add to shell configuration?**
- **Persistence**: Variables set with `export` in terminal only last for that session
- **Consistency**: All new terminal windows will have these settings
- **Convenience**: No need to set variables every time you start the server

**Available Variables**:
```bash
SHRIMP_VIEWER_PORT=9998           # Server port (default: 9998)
SHRIMP_VIEWER_HOST=127.0.0.1      # Server host (localhost only)
```

### Development Configuration

- **Development server with hot reload (Vite)**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev  # Runs on port 3000
  ```
  
  **Why use the development server?** During active development, the Vite dev server provides instant hot module replacement (HMR), meaning your changes appear immediately in the browser without manual refreshing. This dramatically speeds up development by preserving component state between edits and providing instant feedback on your code changes. The dev server also provides better error messages and debugging capabilities.

- **Production build and serve**:
  ```bash
  npm run build && npm start  # Runs on port 9998
  ```
  
  **Why build for production?** The production build optimizes your code by minifying JavaScript, removing dead code, and bundling assets efficiently. This results in faster load times and better performance for end users. Always use the production build when deploying or when you need to test real-world performance.

### Profile Data Storage

**Understanding Profile Data Management**: The Task Viewer uses a hybrid approach to data storage that prioritizes both persistence and real-time accuracy. Profile configurations (like tab names, folder paths, and tab order) are stored locally in a JSON settings file in your home directory, while task data is read directly from your project folders in real-time.

- **Settings File**: `~/.shrimp-task-viewer-settings.json`
  
  This hidden file in your home directory stores all your profile configurations including tab names, folder paths, tab ordering, and other preferences. It's automatically created when you add your first profile and updated whenever you make changes. You can manually edit this file if needed, but be careful to maintain valid JSON formatting.

- **Task Files**: Read directly from specified folder paths (no uploads)
  
  Unlike traditional web applications that upload and store file copies, the Task Viewer reads `tasks.json` files directly from your specified folder paths. This ensures you always see the current state of your tasks without needing to re-upload or sync. When you add a profile, you're simply telling the viewer where to look for the tasks.json file.

- **Hot Reload**: Development changes rebuild automatically
  
  When running in development mode (`npm run dev`), any changes to the source code trigger automatic rebuilds and browser refreshes. This applies to React components, styles, and server code, making development faster and more efficient.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite for hot reload development

**Key Directories Explained**:

- **`src/`**: Contains all React source code. This is where you'll make most UI changes.
- **`dist/`**: Auto-generated production build. Never edit these files directly.
- **`releases/`**: Stores release notes in markdown format with associated images.
- **Root files**: Configuration and server files that handle building, serving, and deployment.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serves the React application
- `GET /api/agents` - Lists all configured profiles
- `GET /api/tasks/{profileId}` - Returns tasks for specific profile
- `POST /api/add-profile` - Adds new profile with folder path
- `DELETE /api/remove-profile/{profileId}` - Removes profile
- `PUT /api/rename-profile/{profileId}` - Rename profile
- `PUT /api/update-profile/{profileId}` - Update profile settings
- `GET /api/readme` - Returns README content for help tab
- `GET /releases/*.md` - Serves release notes markdown files
- `GET /releases/*.png` - Serves release notes images

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Development server runs on http://localhost:3000
# Backend API server runs on http://localhost:9998
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Files are generated in dist/ directory
# Start production server
npm start
```

### Extending the Interface

The modular React architecture makes it easy to extend:

1. **Add New Components**: Create in `src/components/`
2. **Modify Styling**: Edit `src/index.css` with CSS custom properties
3. **Add Features**: Extend `App.jsx` with new state and functionality
4. **API Integration**: Add endpoints in `server.js`

## üîí Security & Performance

### Security Features

- **Localhost Binding**: Server only accessible from local machine
- **Direct File Access**: Reads task files directly from filesystem paths
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained with minimal attack surface
- **CORS Protection**: API endpoints protected with CORS headers

### Performance Optimizations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Won't Start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :9998

# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "node.*server.js"

# Try different port
SHRIMP_VIEWER_PORT=8080 node server.js
```

**Help/Readme Tab Shows HTML**
If the Help tab displays HTML instead of the README content, the server needs to be restarted to load the new API endpoints:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart
npm start
```

**Hot Reload Not Working**
```bash
# Ensure development dependencies are installed
npm install

# Restart development server
npm run dev
```

**Tasks Not Loading**
1. Check that `tasks.json` files contain valid JSON
2. Verify file permissions are readable
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Use manual refresh button to reload data

**Build Errors**
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf dist/
npm run build
```
