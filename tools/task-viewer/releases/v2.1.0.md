# 🚀 Task Viewer v2.1.0 Release Notes

*Released: July 29, 2025*

## 🎉 What's New

### 🔗 Clickable File Paths with Project Root Support
**Copy full file paths with one click!**

- **Click-to-Copy File Paths**: Now when you click on a task, and are taken to the Task Details page, if there are any related files listed that the task modifies or creates, that filename will now have a hyperlink to the actual file on your filesystem (provided that you configure the project folder when creating / editing the profile tab)

### 📋 Enhanced UUID Management
**Streamlined UUID copying with intuitive interactions**

When interfacing with claude, sometimes it is useful to easily reference a shrimp task, for example:
"Claude, please complete this shrimp task: da987923-2afe-4ac3-985e-ac029cc831e7".  Therefore, we added a Click-to-copy feature on Task # badges, and on the UUID listed in the Task Name column.

- **Click-to-Copy Task Badges**: Click any task number badge to instantly copy its UUID
- **Concatinated UUID displayed under task name in Task Name Column**: Click UUID to copy

### 🔄 Task Dependencies Column for easy Paralization 

We added a Dependencies column that lists the linked UUID's of any dependent tasks.  Now you can easily navigate to dependent tasks.

### 🤖 AI Instruction Actions
**One-click AI task instructions**

We added an Actions Column that has a handy Robot emoji. If you click the emoji, it will copy an AI Instruction to the clipboard which you can then paste into your agent's chat.  The instruction has been coded to copy the following: "Use task manager to complete this shrimp task: < UUID >" 

This instruction is useful for paralization. For example, if the following 3 tasks don't have dependencies,you can open up several terminal windows, and paste in the AI Instructions.  Example:

Terminal 1: Use task manager to complete this shrimp task: da987923-2afe-4ac3-985e-ac029cc831e7
Terminal 2: Use task manager to complete this shrimp task: 4afe3f1c-bf7f-4642-8485-668c33a1e0fc
Terminal 3: Use task manager to complete this shrimp task: 21bd2cb9-4109-4897-9904-885ee2b0792e

### ✏️ Profile Edit Button

**Project Root Configuration**: Now you can set project root per profile, this will then allow you to enable full file path copying when "related files" when viewing task the details page.

**Ability to Rename a Profle**: Now you can rename a profile tab without having to delete and recreate.
