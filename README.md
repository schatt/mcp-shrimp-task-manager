## 🧭 <a id="usage-guide"></a>Usage Guide

Shrimp Task Manager offers a structured approach to AI-assisted programming through guided workflows and systematic task management.

### What is Shrimp?

Shrimp is essentially a prompt template that guides AI Agents to better understand and work with your project. It uses a series of prompts to ensure the Agent aligns closely with your project's specific needs and conventions.

### Research Mode in Practice

Before diving into task planning, you can leverage the research mode for technical investigation and knowledge gathering. This is particularly useful when:

- You need to explore new technologies or frameworks
- You want to compare different solution approaches
- You're investigating best practices for your project
- You need to understand complex technical concepts

Simply tell the Agent "research [your topic]" or "enter research mode for [technology/problem]" to begin systematic investigation. The research findings will then inform your subsequent task planning and development decisions.

### First-Time Setup

When working with a new project, simply tell the Agent "init project rules". This will guide the Agent to generate a set of rules tailored to your project's specific requirements and structure.

### Task Planning Process

To develop or update features, use the command "plan task [your description]". The system will reference the previously established rules, attempt to understand your project, search for relevant code sections, and propose a comprehensive plan based on the current state of your project.

### Feedback Mechanism

During the planning process, Shrimp guides the Agent through multiple steps of thinking. You can review this process and provide feedback if you feel it's heading in the wrong direction. Simply interrupt and share your perspective - the Agent will incorporate your feedback and continue the planning process.

### Task Execution

When you're satisfied with the plan, use "execute task [task name or ID]" to implement it. If you don't specify a task name or ID, the system will automatically identify and execute the highest priority task.

### Continuous Mode

If you prefer to execute all tasks in sequence without manual intervention for each task, use "continuous mode" to automatically process the entire task queue.

### Token Limitation Note

Due to LLM token limits, context may be lost during lengthy conversations. If this occurs, simply open a new chat session and ask the Agent to continue execution. The system will pick up where it left off without requiring you to repeat the task details or context.

### Prompt Language and Customization

You can switch the language of system prompts by setting the `TEMPLATES_USE` environment variable. It supports `en` (English) and `zh` (Traditional Chinese) by default. Furthermore, you can copy an existing template directory (e.g., `src/prompts/templates_en`) to the location specified by `DATA_DIR`, modify it, and then point `TEMPLATES_USE` to your custom template directory name. This allows for deeper prompt customization. For detailed instructions.

## 🔬 <a id="research-mode"></a>Research Mode

Shrimp Task Manager includes a specialized research mode designed for systematic technical investigation and knowledge gathering.

### What is Research Mode?

### When to Use Research Mode

Research Mode is particularly valuable for:

- **Technology Exploration**: Investigating new frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Best Practices Research**: Finding industry standards and recommended approaches
- **Solution Comparison**: Evaluating different technical approaches or architectures
- **Problem Investigation**: Deep-diving into complex technical challenges
- **Architecture Planning**: Researching design patterns and system architectures

### How to Use Research Mode

Simply tell the Agent to enter research mode with your topic:

- **Basic usage**: "Enter research mode for [your topic]"
- **Specific research**: "Research [specific technology/problem]"
- **Comparative analysis**: "Research and compare [options A vs B]"

The system will guide the Agent through structured research phases, ensuring thorough investigation while maintaining focus on your specific needs.

### Research Workflow

1. **Topic Definition**: Clearly define the research scope and objectives
2. **Information Gathering**: Systematic collection of relevant information
3. **Analysis and Synthesis**: Processing and organizing findings
4. **State Updates**: Regular progress tracking and context preservation
5. **Integration**: Applying research results to your project context

To install Shrimp Task Manager for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @cjo4m06/mcp-shrimp-task-manager --client claude
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and start service
npm run build
```

## 🔌 <a id="clients"></a>Using with MCP-Compatible Clients

Shrimp Task Manager can be used with any client that supports the Model Context Protocol, such as Cursor IDE.

### Configuration in Cursor IDE

Shrimp Task Manager offers two configuration methods: global configuration and project-specific configuration.

#### ListRoots Protocol Support

Shrimp Task Manager now supports the **ListRoots protocol**, which enables automatic project isolation and flexible path configuration:

- **If your client supports ListRoots** (e.g., Cursor IDE):

  - **Absolute path mode**: Create a project folder within the specified DATA_DIR, enabling you to use a global mcp.json configuration while Shrimp automatically isolates projects
  - **Relative path mode**: Create the DATA_DIR within your project root directory for project-specific data storage

- **If your client doesn't support ListRoots**:
  - DATA_DIR maintains the legacy behavior (absolute paths recommended)
  - We recommend asking your client vendor to support the ListRoots protocol for enhanced functionality

#### Global Configuration

1. Open the Cursor IDE global configuration file (usually located at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
2. Add the following configuration in the `mcpServers` section:

**Option A: Absolute Path (Project Isolation Mode)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/Users/username/ShrimpData", // Absolute path - creates project folders automatically
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: NPX with Absolute Path**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-shrimp-task-manager"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/Users/username/ShrimpData", // Absolute path - creates project folders automatically
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Please replace `/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager` and `/Users/username/ShrimpData` with your actual paths.
>
> 💡 **Absolute Path Advantage**: With ListRoots support, Shrimp automatically creates separate folders for each project (e.g., `/Users/username/ShrimpData/my-project/`, `/Users/username/ShrimpData/another-project/`), enabling perfect project isolation with a single global configuration.
>
> 💡 **Optional:** You can add `"WEB_PORT": "3000"` to the `env` section to specify a custom port for the web GUI. If not specified, an available port will be automatically selected.

#### Project-Specific Configuration

You can also set up dedicated configurations for each project. This method allows using relative paths for project-contained data storage:

1. Create a `.cursor` directory in the project root
2. Create an `mcp.json` file in this directory with the following content:

**Option A: Relative Path (Project-Contained Mode)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": ".shrimp", // Relative path - creates folder within project root
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: NPX with Relative Path**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-shrimp-task-manager"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "shrimp-data", // Relative path - creates folder within project root
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option C: Absolute Path (Alternative)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-shrimp-task-manager"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/Users/username/ShrimpData", // Absolute path with project isolation
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Please replace `/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager` with your actual path.
>
> 💡 **Relative Path Advantage**: Data is stored within your project directory (e.g., `./shrimp-data/`), making it easy to include or exclude from version control as needed.
>
> 💡 **Optional:** You can add `"WEB_PORT": "3000"` to the `env` section to specify a custom port for the web GUI. If not specified, an available port will be automatically selected.

### ⚠️ Important Configuration Notes

The **DATA_DIR parameter** is the directory where Shrimp Task Manager stores task data, conversation logs, and other information. The new implementation supports both absolute and relative paths with intelligent behavior based on your client's capabilities.

#### 🚀 With ListRoots Protocol Support (Recommended)

If your client supports the **ListRoots protocol** (like Cursor IDE), Shrimp Task Manager automatically detects your project root and provides enhanced functionality:

**Absolute Path Mode (Project Isolation):**

- Configuration: `"DATA_DIR": "/Users/username/ShrimpData"`
- Behavior: Creates `{DATA_DIR}/{project-name}/` automatically
- Example: For project "my-app" → `/Users/username/ShrimpData/my-app/`
- **Advantage**: Use one global configuration for all projects with perfect isolation

**Relative Path Mode (Project-Contained):**

- Configuration: `"DATA_DIR": ".shrimp"` or `"DATA_DIR": "shrimp-data"`
- Behavior: Creates `{project-root}/{DATA_DIR}/` within your project
- Example: For DATA_DIR "shrimp-data" → `./shrimp-data/`
- **Advantage**: Data stays with your project, easy to include/exclude from version control

#### ⚠️ Without ListRoots Protocol Support (Legacy Mode)

If your client **doesn't support ListRoots**, the system falls back to legacy behavior:

- **Absolute paths are strongly recommended** to avoid path resolution issues
- Relative paths may cause inconsistent behavior across different environments
- Consider requesting ListRoots support from your client vendor for enhanced functionality

> **Legacy Warning**: Without ListRoots support, using relative paths may cause:
>
> - Data files not found, causing system initialization failure
> - Task status loss or inability to save correctly
> - Inconsistent application behavior across different environments
> - System crashes or failure to start

#### 💡 Choosing the Right Configuration

**Use Absolute Path (Global) when:**

- You want to manage multiple projects with one configuration
- You prefer centralized data storage
- You want automatic project isolation

**Use Relative Path (Project-Specific) when:**

- You want data to stay within the project directory
- You work on projects in different environments
- You need fine control over what gets included in version control

**Use Legacy Mode when:**

- Your client doesn't support ListRoots protocol
- You need compatibility with older client versions

### 🔧 Environment Variable Configuration

Shrimp Task Manager supports customizing prompt behavior through environment variables, allowing you to fine-tune AI assistant responses without modifying code. You can set these variables in the configuration or through an `.env` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shrimp-task-manager": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-shrimp-task-manager/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATA_DIR": "/path/to/project/data",
        "MCP_PROMPT_PLAN_TASK": "Custom planning guidance...",
        "MCP_PROMPT_EXECUTE_TASK_APPEND": "Additional execution instructions...",
        "TEMPLATES_USE": "en",
        "ENABLE_GUI": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There are two customization methods:

- **Override Mode** (`MCP_PROMPT_[FUNCTION_NAME]`): Completely replace the default prompt
- **Append Mode** (`MCP_PROMPT_[FUNCTION_NAME]_APPEND`): Add content to the existing prompt

Additionally, there are other system configuration variables:

- **DATA_DIR**: Specifies the directory where task data is stored
- **TEMPLATES_USE**: Specifies the template set to use for prompts. Defaults to `en`. Currently available options are `en` and `zh`. To use custom templates, copy the `src/prompts/templates_en` directory to the location specified by `DATA_DIR`, rename the copied directory (e.g., to `my_templates`), and set `TEMPLATES_USE` to the new directory name (e.g., `my_templates`)
- **ENABLE_GUI**: Enables or disables the web-based graphical user interface. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable (default)
- **WEB_PORT**: Specifies the port for the web GUI. If not specified, an available port will be automatically selected. Only takes effect when `ENABLE_GUI` is set to `true`

For detailed instructions on customizing prompts, including supported parameters and examples, see the [Prompt Customization Guide](docs/en/prompt-customization.md).

## 💡 <a id="prompt"></a>System Prompt Guidance

### Cursor IDE Configuration

You can enable Cursor Settings => Features => Custom modes, and configure the following two modes:

#### TaskPlanner Mode

```
You are a professional task planning expert. You must interact with users, analyze their needs, and collect project-related information. Finally, you must use "plan_task" to create tasks. When the task is created, you must summarize it and inform the user to use the "TaskExecutor" mode to execute the task.
You must focus on task planning. Do not use "execute_task" to execute tasks.
Serious warning: you are a task planning expert, you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks, and you cannot modify the program code directly, you can only plan tasks.
```

#### TaskExecutor Mode

```
You are a professional task execution expert. When a user specifies a task to execute, use "execute_task" to execute the task.
If no task is specified, use "list_tasks" to find unexecuted tasks and execute them.
When the execution is completed, a summary must be given to inform the user of the conclusion.
You can only perform one task at a time, and when a task is completed, you are prohibited from performing the next task unless the user explicitly tells you to.
If the user requests "continuous mode", all tasks will be executed in sequence.
```

> 💡 Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs:
>
> - Use **TaskPlanner** mode when planning tasks
> - Use **TaskExecutor** mode when executing tasks

### Using with Other Tools

If your tool doesn't support Custom modes, you can:

- Manually paste the appropriate prompts at different stages
- Or directly use simple commands like `Please plan the following task: ......` or `Please start executing the task...`
